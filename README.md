# ðŸ“š Push Swap

`Push Swap` is a sorting algorithm project implemented in C. The goal is to implement an efficient sorting algorithm using two stacks (`A` and `B`) and a set of operations. The project is about sorting integers with the minimum number of operations while adhering to strict requirements on the types of operations that can be used.

## ðŸ›  Features

### Core Features
- **Push**: Move the top element of one stack to the other.
- **Swap**: Swap the top two elements of a stack.
- **Rotate**: Rotate all elements of a stack up by one, with the top element going to the bottom.
- **Reverse Rotate**: Rotate all elements of a stack down by one, with the bottom element going to the top.
- **Sorting**: The program sorts a list of integers into ascending order using the fewest operations possible.

### Operations
- **sa**: Swap the first two elements of stack A.
- **sb**: Swap the first two elements of stack B.
- **ss**: Swap the first two elements of both stack A and B.
- **pa**: Push the top element of stack B onto stack A.
- **pb**: Push the top element of stack A onto stack B.
- **ra**: Rotate stack A upwards.
- **rb**: Rotate stack B upwards.
- **rr**: Rotate both stacks A and B upwards.
- **rra**: Rotate stack A downwards.
- **rrb**: Rotate stack B downwards.
- **rrr**: Rotate both stacks A and B downwards.

### Algorithm
- **Push** and **Swap** operations are used to transform the unsorted list into a sorted list.
- The project aims to find the best sequence of operations to minimize the number of moves.
  
### Sorting Strategies
- **Three Elements**: If the list has three or fewer elements, it's sorted using a simple method of swapping and rotating.
- **Five Elements**: For lists of five elements, a more advanced sorting method is used, involving finding the optimal positions for the smallest elements and swapping them.
- **Larger Lists**: For larger lists, the algorithm focuses on breaking down the problem, using cost-effective movements to sort the elements.

## ðŸš€ Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/push_swap.git
   cd push_swap
2. Compile the library using the Makefile:
    ```bash
    make
3. Run the program with a list of integers:
    ```bash
    ./push_swap 5 4 3 2 1
4. Use the checker program to verify if the result is correct:
    ```bash
    ./checker 5 4 3 2 1
